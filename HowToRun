How To Run The Echo Example:

0. Being in a terminal on the root of the project

    1. First, Start the Relay Server
        - sh ./relay.sh ${port}

    2. Second, raise the echo server
        - sh ./echoserver ${relay_host} ${relay_port}

        (A second TCP channel is going to be exposed on a different port than the previous one where)

    3. Third, connect to the echoserver through the relay server with telnet
        - telnet ${relay_host} ${relay_port}
